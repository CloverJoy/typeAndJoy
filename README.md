## Ready to know yourself better?
Type & Joy is a dynamic MBTI Personality test and CMS web application built by MERN stack technology.
After taking MBTI test, you can also share your type to the world with the Type Board (Of course you can use your alias or nickname).
This app provides the real-time test administration systems. For the administrator, you can create new question also delete the question, and it will automatically update to the personality test! For new question, the logic for the MBTI test is already implemented in the App, So you only need the question and type answer for the input.
